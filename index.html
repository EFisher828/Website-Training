     The index.html file is considered the primary html file in web projects.
     For ex., the index.html file is what loads if you visit https://www.monarchweatherenterprise.com/
     https://www.monarchweatherenterprise.com/index.html would take you to the same page

     This file demonstrates some of the most important structural components of web design.
     In particular, understanding how html and css work in tandem is crucial to understanding how MonarchView functions.

         The <head> section contains important metadata and links to css stylesheets and some js external files.
         In this case, we've linked to the stylesheet 'main.css' in the 'css' directory.
         This naming convention is not strict, but main.css is good practice, and the css subdirectory is personal preference.

         div elements are fundamental to organizing any webpage.
         In essence, they are organizing blocks within which text, images, table, and all other elements can be placed
         div elements have no inherent width or height, but rather take the shape of the elements they contain.
         div elements *can* be given predefined width and height with css.
         The div below has been given a width and height using css, please see '#primaryDiv' in main.css.
         The primaryDiv id gives the div other important css rules as well.

    <div id="primaryDiv">
      <!-- This header is centered because primaryDiv has property 'text-align: center;'-->
      <h3>This is a Header - Smaller, Centered Words!</h3>
      <!--
           divs can be nested within one another.
           This div utilizes the display: flex; css property to align some images horizontally.
      -->
      <div class="subDiv">
          <!-- This is an image tag. It requires a src attribute, with optional attributes such as alt, class, id, etc. -->
          <img src="./images/clouds-v1.png" alt="Images should have alt text" class="subDivImg">
          <p>The items in this div are horizontally aligned. The items <i>are not</i> wrapped in another div with flex: 1; like the div below, resulting in an uneven distribution of the horizontal space.</p>
          <img src="./images/clouds-v2.png" alt="That explain what they display" class="subDivImg">
          <!-- This is a link tag. It requires an href attribute, but has other optional attributes as well -->

          <img src="./images/clouds-v3.png" alt="For the visually impaired" class="subDivImg">
      </div>

      <div class="subDiv">
        <div class="evenSpacing">
          <img src="./images/clouds-v1.png" alt="Images should have alt text" class="subDivImg">
        </div>
        <div class="evenSpacing">
          <p>The items in this div are horizontally aligned. The items <b>are</b> wrapped in another div with flex: 1;, resulting in an even distribution of the horizontal space. It doesn't matter how much I type here, the widths will remain constant!</p>

      <p id="additionalInfo">As rudimentary as this example may seem, it touches on many of the HTML and CSS elements that are central to MonarchView. If you can master the design of a webpage, the behind-the-scenes functionality will make much more sense. I would say that display: flex; divs are the most crucial to master, as the majority of MonarchView's strucutre is flexed.  Let me know if you have any questions, and when you feel comfortable with HTML/CSS, I'll pass along a demo with JavaScript!</p>
